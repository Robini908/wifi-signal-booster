## Overview

Signal Booster is a powerful terminal-based Python application designed to optimize your network connection for maximum performance. It works by implementing multiple system-level optimizations to enhance both WiFi signal strength and internet speed.

**Key Features:**

- üöÄ **Speed Optimization**: Boost your download and upload speeds
- üì∂ **Signal Enhancement**: Improve WiFi signal reception and stability
- üîç **Network Diagnostics**: Identify and fix network performance issues
- üìä **Real-time Monitoring**: Track network performance with a live dashboard
- üõ°Ô∏è **System Protection**: Safe optimizations with rollback capabilities

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.7 or higher
- Administrative privileges (required for network configuration)
- Compatible with Windows, macOS, and Linux

### Install from Source

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/example/signal-booster.git
   cd signal-booster
   ```

2. Create and activate a virtual environment:
   ```bash
   # On Windows
   python -m venv venv
   venv\Scripts\activate

   # On macOS/Linux
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate
   ```

3. Install the package:
   ```bash
   # Basic installation
   pip install -e .
   
   # Full installation with enhanced network interface detection (requires C++ build tools)
   pip install -e .[full]
   ```

## Usage

Signal Booster provides a powerful command-line interface with several commands:

### Start Boosting

To start boosting your network performance:

```bash
# Basic usage with default settings
signal-booster start

# Specify target speed (in Mbps)
signal-booster start --target-speed 10

# Enable aggressive optimization techniques
signal-booster start --aggressive

# Show live monitoring dashboard
signal-booster start --monitor
```

### Run Diagnostic Tests

To diagnose network issues without making any changes:

```bash
signal-booster test
```

### View System Information

To view detailed system and network information:

```bash
signal-booster info
```

### Additional Options

For help and to see all available options:

```bash
signal-booster --help
```

## How It Works

Signal Booster uses several techniques to optimize your network:

1. **TCP/IP Stack Optimization**: Adjusts TCP window size, buffer settings, and other parameters for improved throughput
2. **DNS Optimization**: Configures faster and more reliable DNS servers
3. **QoS (Quality of Service)**: Prioritizes important network traffic
4. **WiFi Configuration**: Optimizes wireless adapter settings for better signal and throughput
5. **System-Level Optimization**: Adjusts system settings that impact network performance
6. **Advanced Monitoring**: Continually monitors and adjusts settings based on real-time performance
